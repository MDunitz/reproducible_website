  Analysis of microtubule catastrophe
  Here we compare two different models for microtubule collapse. Utilizing data from the generated by Garner et al ([Garner, Zanic, and coworkers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.037))
  We compared measurements of microtubule catastrophe times for experiments using fluorescently labeled tubulin and unlabeled tubulin. 
  Here we investigated microtubule catastrophe using labeled tubulin for different concentrations of total tubulin. 
  We found that a gamma distribution model more accurately represented the emperically generated data (as compared to a two step poisson process)
